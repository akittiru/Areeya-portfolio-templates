# Outline
I’ve always loved matcha, so when I kept hearing news about prices rising, I got curious. I know part of it comes from how popular matcha has become lately (everyone seems to be drinking it) but I wanted to understand what else is driving the increase. Is it supply? Is it production costs? And honestly, as someone who just wants my usual matcha at the price I used to pay, I can’t help wondering: will matcha ever go back down in price, or is this the new normal?

In this visualization, I want to share the curiosity that led me to explore matcha prices and help readers become smarter consumers. My goal is for them to understand why matcha has become more expensive, recognize when a product is overpriced, and learn the logic behind price changes driven by popularity and shifting demand. By seeing these patterns, readers can apply the same thinking to other trendy foods or products in the future and better navigate how prices evolve over time.

I followed the core storytelling arc of setup → conflict → resolution, beginning with what matcha is and why people love it, then escalating into rising demand, shrinking supply, and finally the impact on prices and consumers.
This is the overall story I want to tell, and it can be built up step-by-step following this sequence.

# 🍵 Matcha Story: Why Are Prices Rising?

Sub-causes:
- Climate change  
  - Map idea: Climate change impact on tea-growing regions in Japan
- Labor shortage  
  - Fewer farmers, aging population
- Production constraints  
  - Timeline: Growing → shading → harvesting → steaming → grinding  
  - Highlight: High-quality matcha can take ~2 years from field to cup

## 8. As a consumer, what can I do? 🧠  
**How to be a smarter matcha drinker**

- Switch to alternative products:
  - Other green teas, hojicha, sencha, etc.
- Consider non-Japanese matcha:

  - Buy in bulk, check grams per serving, compare price per gram


## 9. If you’re rich (or just refuse to give up matcha) 😎  
**Where to go for the “best of the best”**

- Curate a short list of specialty tea houses / matcha cafés
- Position: “If you decide to pay premium prices, at least pay for real quality.”
- Optional: Small map or list by city


## 🔚 Takeaway

By the end of this story, the reader should:
- Understand *why* matcha prices have gone up  
- Recognize the link between popularity, supply constraints, and climate/labor issues  
- Learn how to avoid overpaying and apply the same logic to other “trendy” foods

## Initial sketches
This is my first draft. I haven’t thought about other aspects yet, so it mainly focuses on price movement.
<img width="1020" height="457" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8b2f106-1d51-48b8-a1da-b4b09c104c34" />

After that, I tried looking up matcha data, but it turned out to be REALLY difficult.
Matcha is just one specific type of tea, so there aren’t many detailed records available. Most of the sources I found were in Japanese, so I had to rely heavily on translation tools. Moreover, many of them were infographics or charts without exact numbers. Some only gave rough estimates or skipped several years because the data wasn’t recorded.
So it was definitely a challenge. I might have to create a visualization based on qualitative data, which isn’t my favorite, while I continue searching for solid quantitative sources.

# The data
My data comes from a wide range of sources. I pulled insights from major publications like Time, Forbes, and The Atlantic; trade statistics from Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture; and additional supporting information from websites that sell matcha tea powder. Together, these sources helped me piece together both the qualitative story and the limited quantitative data available.

# Method and medium
For this project, I plan to gather a mix of qualitative and quantitative data from news articles, government reports, and industry websites. Because many sources were already visualized, I focused on extracting qualitative insights that I can redesign into new visuals. Since my dataset is relatively small, I will use Datawrapper as my main visualization tool—its interface is user-friendly and supports interactive charts that work well with limited data. I don’t expect to use Tableau extensively for this project, as the data volume is not large enough to require more complex analysis.
