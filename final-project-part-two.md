# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
To figure out who my story should speak to, I started by looking at who actually drinks matcha the most right now thorugh social media and using my own experience. Gen Z and Millennials clearly dominate matcha culture because they’re active on Instagram, TikTok, they visit cafés regularly, and they’re the ones buying matcha lattes, desserts, and soft serves almost every week. These are also the people who immediately notice when prices go up.

So the group I want to reach with my visualization is:
- Young matcha lovers who care about why their favorite drink is suddenly getting more expensive and want to make smarter decisions as consumers
- Young consumers that want to know what happens to their favorite drink in the next 5–10 years

In short, If you’re between 12 and 44 and have ever posted a photo of yourself happily holding a matcha drink, and are still struggling to find the best matcha spot in a new town....you’re my target audience!

## Interview script
| **Goal** | **Questions to Ask** |
|---------|------------------------|
| Understand matcha habits | • How often do you drink matcha (latte, desserts, soft serve, etc.)?<br>• Where do you usually buy matcha?<br>• Do you notice when matcha prices change?<br>• How much do you typically spend on matcha?<br>• When you move to a new city, do you search for matcha spots? How? |
| Understand what they want to know about rising prices | • Have you wondered why matcha is getting more expensive?<br>• Which reason are you most curious about (climate, labor shortage, demand, supply chain)?<br>• Do you think matcha drinks are overpriced?<br>• What kind of explanation would feel most useful for you? |
| Identify missing information | • When matcha prices rise, what is the first question that comes to your mind?<br>• What part of the matcha supply chain is unclear to you?<br>• What comparisons would you like to see (matcha vs coffee, matcha grades, café markup)?<br>• What do you wish cafés were more transparent about? |
| **Evaluate my storyboard (outline below)** | **My Storyboard Outline:**<br>1. Overview of matcha price increase over recent years<br>2. Climate and harvest issues in major production regions (Japan/Kagoshima/Uji)<br>3. Labor shortages and aging farmers<br>4. Growing global demand (especially from Gen Z & Millennials)<br>5. Comparison of matcha grades and price differences<br>6. Café markups vs raw matcha cost<br>7. What this means for you as a consumer<br><br>**Questions:**<br>• Are these sections helpful for understanding the price rise?<br>• Which part feels most useful for you?<br>• Is there anything in the outline that you don’t need or don’t care about?<br>• Is there anything missing that you would want me to include?<br>• Does this storyboard feel too long, too short, or just right? |
| Evaluate overall helpfulness | • After seeing the storyboard, do you understand the key reasons behind matcha price increases?<br>• Did the visuals help you understand the trend?<br>• Do you feel more informed as a consumer?<br>• Would this change how you buy or choose matcha? |
| Understand emotional/personal connection | • What do you love most about matcha?<br>• How would you feel if matcha keeps becoming more expensive?<br>• Would you switch to alternatives or stay loyal?<br>• Do you care where your matcha comes from? |
| Fun but insightful questions | • Have you ever posted a “happy matcha photo”?<br>• What makes a matcha drink worth posting?<br>• What’s the most expensive matcha you’ve bought — and was it worth it? |
