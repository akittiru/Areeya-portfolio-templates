# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
To figure out who my story should speak to, I started by looking at who actually drinks matcha the most right now thorugh social media and using my own experience. Gen Z and Millennials clearly dominate matcha culture because they’re active on Instagram, TikTok, they visit cafés regularly, and they’re the ones buying matcha lattes, desserts, and soft serves almost every week. These are also the people who immediately notice when prices go up.

So the group I want to reach with my visualization is:
- Young matcha lovers who care about why their favorite drink is suddenly getting more expensive and want to make smarter decisions as consumers
- Young consumers that want to know what happens to their favorite drink in the next 5–10 years

In short, If you’re between 12 and 44 and have ever posted a photo of yourself happily holding a matcha drink, and are still struggling to find the best matcha spot in a new town....you’re my target audience!
