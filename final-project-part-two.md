# User research 

## Target audience
To figure out who my story should speak to, I started by looking at who actually drinks matcha the most right now thorugh social media and using my own experience. Gen Z and Millennials clearly dominate matcha culture because they’re active on Instagram, TikTok, they visit cafés regularly, and they’re the ones buying matcha lattes, desserts, and soft serves almost every week. These are also the people who immediately notice when prices go up.

So the group I want to reach with my visualization is:
- Young matcha lovers who care about why their favorite drink is suddenly getting more expensive and want to make smarter decisions as consumers
- Young consumers that want to know what happens to their favorite drink in the next 5–10 years

In short, If you’re between 12 and 44 and have ever posted a photo of yourself happily holding a matcha drink, and are still struggling to find the best matcha spot in a new town....you’re my target audience!

> **Remark:** I may not be able to ask every question listed above. These represent my main guiding questions, but depending on the time available and the interview setting, I may have to skip or shorten certain questions. Some participants may only have a few minutes, so I will focus on the most essential ones during shorter interviews.


| Question | Interviewee #1 | Interviewee #2 | Interviewee #3 | Interviewee #4 | Interviewee #5 |
|---------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| How often do you drink matcha? | 2–3 times per week | 1 cup a day or sometimes none because it's getting expensive. | Twice a month | About twice a month; I drink matcha latte. | About once a week; sometimes mixed with coffee or coconut water. |
| Where do you usually buy matcha? | Shops near office or make at home | I used to buy from cafés, but now I mostly make at home. | Cafés / coffee shops | Matcha cafés or 7-Eleven. | A matcha shop under my office. |
| Do you notice when matcha prices change? | Yes | Yes | Yes | No, because I buy the cheapest one. | Yes, matcha is trending and prices have increased. |
| How much do you typically spend on matcha? (THB converted to USD) | $3 | Before: $55–80/month. Now: $30–40/month. | $3.30 | $2.50 | $1.9–$3.3 |
| Have you wondered why matcha is getting more expensive? | Not really; trendy items become pricier | Yes | Because it’s trendy | Demand increased because it’s trending and part of café branding. | Yes, and I also wonder why it suddenly became a trend. |
| Which reason are you most curious about? | Production time, shortages, true cost | Climate impacts and labor shortages. | Climate | Climate change + shortages in Japan | Demand increase |
| Do you think matcha drinks are overpriced? | Yes | Yes, some cafés feel overpriced and raise prices because matcha is trendy. | Yes | Overpriced, unsure if only in Thailand or globally | Yes, very overpriced |
| What kind of explanation feels most useful? | Flavor descriptions | Parts of the supply chain that increased in cost. | Good taste + reasonable price | I don’t understand the question | Trend + storytelling make it overpriced |
| When matcha prices rise, what’s the first question? | What is the real cost? | Whether production dropped or cafés are increasing prices for profit. | Is it worth trying? | Global or Thailand? Import tax? Shortage? | Why is it so expensive? |
| What part of the supply chain is unclear? | Not sure | The labor part | Crop and harvest | Where cost spikes occur (tax, production, shipping) | How raw materials are sourced and whether import cost justifies the price |
| What comparisons would you like to see? | Matcha grades + taste + price/gram | Price differences by grade and how prices changed over the years. | Matcha grades | Café markup | Matcha vs coffee |
| Are the storyboard sections helpful? | Yes | Yes, especially the supply-side explanation. | Not really | A bit; too detailed on tea | Yes |
| Which storyboard parts are most useful? | Sections 1 and 9 | Declining production | Not sure | Supply-side issues + rising prices | Sections 5 and 6 |
| Anything unnecessary? | 2 & 3 could combine; 5 & 6 could combine | Basic matcha information. Most people already know it. | Not sure | Sections 1 and 9 not relevant | None; all relevant |
| Anything missing you'd want to learn? | Famous brands + price ranges | How to choose good matcha at a reasonable price. | Objective + whether desserts included | Demand, supply, regions, taxes, freight | Future trend: will matcha fade like Thai tea/purple yam trends or stay like coffee? |
| Is the storyboard too long or short? | A bit long | It's fine | Too long + unclear | Not too long, some irrelevant | Just right |
| What do you love most about matcha? | Taste; childhood love for green tea KitKat | The aroma and steady energy | It tastes good | Makes me feel healthier; customizable | Healthy caffeine; good alternative to coffee |
| How would you feel if prices keep rising? | Would drink less | Disappointed | Consumption would decrease | Won’t consume it if too expensive | I won’t pay; many alternatives |
| Would you switch to alternatives? | Cocoa or hojicha | Maybe, but no alternative feels the same as matcha. | Prefer coffee | Would switch; drink occasionally | Ready to switch |
| Do you care about origin/grade? | Good taste + no flour | Yes, quality affects flavor and aroma a lot. | Only taste and price | Don’t care as long as it’s real | Care a bit due to storytelling; won’t repurchase if overpriced |
| Do you understand price rise reasons now? | Yes | Yes | Yes (not deeply) | Not sure | Yes, roughly |
| Did the visuals help you understand the trend? | Yes | Yes | Yes | Not fully | Yes |
| Do you feel more informed as a consumer? | Yes | Yes | Not sure | Not sure | Yes |




# Identified changes for Part III


| Findings or Observations from Interviews | Anticipated Changes to Address the Observation |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Storyboard does not clearly explain how matcha prices rise | Add clearer supply–demand logic and show causal links visually |
| Lacks concrete data on production, demand, and supply | Incorporate estimated or approximate figures to strengthen explanations |
| Too many small topics that distract from the main message | Combine related sections to make the narrative more concise |
| Audience already knows basic matcha concepts | Shift focus toward deeper insights (climate impact, labor, export issues, trend-driven demand) |
| Audience wants to understand the “why” behind price increases | Emphasize underlying factors and provide layered explanations |

During the interviews, I realized that my audience actually splits into two groups:
(1) people who want deeper, more sophisticated insights about matcha, and
(2) people who just want simple, conversational knowledge they can use casually.

This made me consider whether I should narrow my target audience and create a more specific persona—not just based on age, but also on their interests and what they want from the content. However, my original intention was to create something more general and accessible for everyone. After thinking about it, I still want to keep it as general knowledge, but I’ll acknowledge the different needs and try to balance depth with simplicity.


# My revised storyboard (might not be able to complete all of these, but here is my expected full-list)
1. Why Matcha Prices Are Rising
2. The Demand Surge
3. Supply Constraints (Core of the Story)<br>
      3.1 Climate Pressure<br>
      3.2 Labor Shortages<br>
      3.3 Slow, Craft-Based Production<br>
4. The Price Mechanism
5.Price Trends Over Time
6. Cost Breakdown Snapshot
7. How Rising Costs Affect Consumers
8. Practical Matcha Buying Tips
9. Future Outlook

# Moodboards / personas
I decided not to create a persona because it would take too much time and isn’t necessary for my audience. I want to keep the target group fairly generic. Instead, I found a mood board that I really like. The matcha green pairs well with black, and using light text on a darker background makes everything easier to read.

However, when I started building the story in Shorthand, I realized that some Datawrapper charts don’t automatically adjust to dark mode or dark backgrounds. I tried figuring it out but couldn’t get the charts to display correctly, so I switched to a green background instead. I’ll continue following this color palette moving forward.

## AI acknowledgements
I used AI to help me organize and format the interview responses into a structured table, convert everything into Markdown, reduce the size of picture in Markdown, and clean up my language. AI also helped me analyze which parts of my current storyboard need improvement so I can revise it to better meet the requirements for Part III, and also help suggesting the revised storyboard to make sure it make sense while providing information that Matcha drinkers want to know.
