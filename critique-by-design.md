# What animal could you beat in a fight?
This is a critique of a visualization "Percentage of Amercian men and women that confident on winning battle with animals

## Step one: the visualization
The original visualization Link https://today.yougov.com/society/articles/35852-lions-and-tigers-and-bears-what-animal-would-win-f

I chose to re-visualize this chart because I personally enjoy animal-related content, and I find this dataset particularly interesting since it’s not something we encounter in everyday life. While the topic itself is creative, the original chart does not fully reflect that creativity. I wanted to apply what I learned in class along with my own imagination to redesign the visualization in a way that is clearer, more engaging, and better aligned with the playful nature of the content!

## Step two: the critique
This visualization presents survey data showing what percentage of men and women believe they could win in a fight against various animals.
At a high level, the original chart is informative and conveys a clear upward or downward trend based on the animal’s perceived difficulty. However, there are several aspects that could be enhanced.
1) The audience of this chart would be in people that interested in animals, behavioral psychology, gender differences, or could be children.
   Although the chart provides clear information, it may lack attractiveness to be educational or exploratory.
2) The color choices are unintuitive. Using non-standard gender cues (like blue or pink) makes decoding slower.
3) The grey background grid creates visual noise and competes with the data.
4) The grid lines and background create unnecessary clutter.
5) Clearer depictions of the animals would make it easier for viewers to understand their actual size.
6) The numbers on the X-Axis seem redundant since we already know they represent percentages.

## Step three: Sketch a solution
My first draft of revision solution is here.

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
