# What animal could you beat in a fight?
This is a critique of a visualization "Percentage of Amercian men and women that confident on winning battle with animals

## Step one: the visualization

I chose to re-visualize this chart because I personally enjoy animal-related content, and I find this dataset particularly interesting since it’s not something we encounter in everyday life. While the topic itself is creative, the original chart does not fully reflect that creativity. I wanted to apply what I learned in class along with my own imagination to redesign the visualization in a way that is clearer, more engaging, and better aligned with the playful nature of the content!

## Step two: the critique
This visualization presents survey data showing what percentage of men and women believe they could win in a fight against various animals.
At a high level, the original chart is informative and conveys a clear upward or downward trend based on the animal’s perceived difficulty. However, there are several aspects that could be enhanced.
1) The audience of this chart would be in people that interested in animals, behavioral psychology, gender differences, or could be children.
   Although the chart provides clear information, it may lack attractiveness to be educational or exploratory.
2) The color choices are unintuitive. Using non-standard gender cues (like blue or pink) makes decoding slower.
3) The grey background grid creates visual noise and competes with the data.
4) The grid lines and background create unnecessary clutter.
5) Clearer depictions of the animals would make it easier for viewers to understand their actual size.
6) The numbers on the X-Axis seem redundant since we already know they represent percentages.

## Step three: Sketch a solution
My first draft of revision solution is here.

| **Does it make sense to show the data this way compared to the original?** | It’s understandable, and this chart helps people see that it’s about animals better than the original, where you have to read the title again. | Creative and interesting way to show the data.                                                    | Good, but the original one is also easy to understand.                                           | Yes, it makes sense. It’s more enjoyable to read.                                                                          |
| **What do you like about this design?**                                    | I like the idea of using animal icons instead of just a plain chart.                                                                           | It’s helpful to see the icons of the animals.                                                     | It’s more picturable.                                                                            | I like that it shows the size of the average human alongside the size of each animal.                                       |

| **Is there anything you would change or do differently?**                  | Might try using a vertical stacked bar chart.                                                                                                  | Could try a unit chart and place animals side-by-side, like showing an elephant in blue and pink. | The numbers are really small and might be difficult to maintain consistently across all animals. | No need to show very small animals because everyone knows we can beat something like a rat.                                 |

Synthesis: 
Everyone understood the redesigned chart right away, and most people felt it was more creative, visually engaging, and easier to interpret than the original. They especially liked the use of animal icons and the comparison between each animal’s size and a human figure, which made the chart feel more intuitive and fun. At the same time, several viewers pointed out issues with readability. They mentioned that the numbers were too small, the border between the gender colors was hard to see, and the blue–pink color scheme wasn’t always clear. Some also shared that the scale could be confusing, and a couple of people felt that including very small animals wasn’t necessary because the outcome is obvious.

From this feedback, I think that the overall concept of using visuals and icons works well, but clarity and precision still need improvement. Viewers respond positively to creative elements as long as they don’t interfere with understanding the data.

I also asked for a feedback from ChatGPT as well as it might have different angle that human may not think of. This is ChatGPT's feedback:
"Your visualization is fun, creative, and easy to engage with, especially through the use of hand-drawn animal icons. However, the overlapping blue and pink areas make it hard to distinguish gender differences, and the numbers inside the animals are too small to read clearly. The animal sizes are also inconsistent, which can cause confusion, and the very small animals (like the rat) are difficult to see and may not add meaningful insight. Cleaning up the color separation, enlarging or repositioning the numbers, improving size consistency, and possibly removing unnecessary animals would make the chart clearer and more effective."

I think the most meaningful design changes for my final redesign will focus on improving readability such as increasing the text size, strengthening the color contrast, and make sure the scales are accurate. I will also reconsider whether to include extremely small animals. I belive these changes will help maintain the playful, engaging design while making the visualization easier to interpret.


## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._

For reference, I found another version of this data in the attached image. It seems like this type of chart is easier to understand, but I still want to try changing the look and tone.

## AI acknowledgements
I used ChatGPT.AI to help me review and improve my first draft by generating detailed feedback on the clarity, readability, and overall effectiveness of my visualization. It also supported me in writing concise explanations in my assignment. In addition, I used ChatGPT to help create a feedback box using Markdown code.
