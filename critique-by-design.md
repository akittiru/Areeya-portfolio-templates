# What animal could you beat in a fight?
This is a critique of a visualization "Percentage of Amercian men and women that confident on winning battle with animals

## Step one: the visualization

I chose to re-visualize this chart because I personally enjoy animal-related content, and I find this dataset particularly interesting since it’s not something we encounter in everyday life. While the topic itself is creative, the original chart does not fully reflect that creativity. I wanted to apply what I learned in class along with my own imagination to redesign the visualization in a way that is clearer, more engaging, and better aligned with the playful nature of the content!

## Step two: the critique
This visualization presents survey data showing what percentage of men and women believe they could win in a fight against various animals.
At a high level, the original chart is informative and conveys a clear upward or downward trend based on the animal’s perceived difficulty. However, there are several aspects that could be enhanced.
1) The audience of this chart would be in people that interested in animals, behavioral psychology, gender differences, or could be children.
   Although the chart provides clear information, it may lack attractiveness to be educational or exploratory.
2) The color choices are unintuitive. Using non-standard gender cues (like blue or pink) makes decoding slower.
3) The grey background grid creates visual noise and competes with the data.
4) The grid lines and background create unnecessary clutter.
5) Clearer depictions of the animals would make it easier for viewers to understand their actual size.
6) The numbers on the X-Axis seem redundant since we already know they represent percentages.

## Step three: Sketch a solution
My first draft of revision solution is here.

## Step four: Test the solution

| **Question**                                                               | **Interview 2: DA student**                                                                                                                    | **Interview 1: DA student**                                                                       | **Interview 3: DA student**                                                                      | **Interview 3: MBA student**                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Do you understand what this chart is about?**                            | Yes                                                                                                                                            | Yes                                                                                               | Yes                                                                                              | Yes                                                                                                                         |
| **Does it make sense to show the data this way compared to the original?** | It’s understandable, and this chart helps people see that it’s about animals better than the original, where you have to read the title again. | Creative and interesting way to show the data.                                                    | Good, but the original one is also easy to understand.                                           | Yes, it makes sense — it’s more enjoyable to read.                                                                          |
| **What do you like about this design?**                                    | I like the idea of using animal icons instead of just a plain chart.                                                                           | It’s helpful to see the icons of the animals.                                                     | It’s more picturable.                                                                            | I like that it shows the size of the average human alongside the size of each animal.                                       |
| **Is there anything surprising or confusing?**                             | No                                                                                                                                             | The scale might be difficult to make accurate.                                                    | No                                                                                               | Might not need to categorize animals into large/medium/small because we can already compare them with the human silhouette. |
| **Is there anything you would change or do differently?**                  | Might try using a vertical stacked bar chart.                                                                                                  | Could try a unit chart and place animals side-by-side, like showing an elephant in blue and pink. | The numbers are really small and might be difficult to maintain consistently across all animals. | No need to show very small animals because everyone knows we can beat something like a rat.                                 |
| **Further comments**                                                       | The slim border between pink and blue might be hard to see.                                                                                    | –                                                                                                 | Could change from blue/pink to gender symbols.                                                   | Should add percentage signs to make the numbers clearer.                                                                    |
