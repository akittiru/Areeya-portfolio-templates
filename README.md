# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi there! Iâ€™m Areeya Kittiruangthong, an MBA student at Carnegie Mellon University. I used to work in corporate banking, so Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time crunching numbers, building reports, and helping executives make decisions.

Lately, Iâ€™ve realized that numbers alone arenâ€™t enoughâ€”how you show them really matters. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m getting into data visualization to turn complex info into something people can actually understand and act on quickly.

Iâ€™m a basic Excel user whoâ€™s learning to go beyond spreadsheets. Iâ€™ve used Tableau and Power BI before (though itâ€™s been a while, so Iâ€™m a bit rusty ðŸ˜…). I also love art and design, and Iâ€™m hoping to blend that creative side with analytics to make visuals that are clear, simple, and fun to look at.

# What I hope to learn
1. To learn how to make good visualizations while still keeping the logic and interpretation accurate
2. Understand what to consider from the readerâ€™s perspective
3. Explore new tools to create better data visualizations
4. Find more inspiring design ideas since my current designs feel quite limited
5. Get familiar to work with different types of data outside my specialized field
6. Learn how to make data visualizations more universal, so anyone can understand them easily

# Examples
You can keep this section for stuff from in-class demos or your other work, or remove it. 

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/pt-br/@charlesdeluvio?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">charlesdeluvio</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/K4mSJ7kc0As?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>
  

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
