# Changes made since Part II
After I gathered all the feedback from my audiences, it helped me to cleary focus on what are important for them. There are many data that I find it useful but I ended up did not using them because I need to make it clean and concise as my audiences are generation that has short attention spand and usually spend only 30 seconds to judge whether this source of data is helpful.
