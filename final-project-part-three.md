# The final data story
Dear Matcha, Why You So Pricey?

# Changes made since Part II
After gathering all the feedback from my audience, it helped me clearly focus on what was most important to them. There were many data points I found useful, but I ended up not using them because I needed the presentation to stay clean and concise. My audience is a generation with a short attention span, and they usually spend only about 30 seconds deciding whether the information is helpful.

While developing the new storyline, I also tried to make the language more consistent and ensure the audience was learning throughout the presentation. A clear call to action was also key, so I tried to provide information that is practical as much as possible.

I also adjusted the moodboard tone. In Part II, I originally planned to use green and black. However, after embedding my charts, I noticed that the black background reduced the charts’ visibility and clashed with the background photos, most of which have a light, soft tone (like a cute cup of matcha latte in a café).


## The audience
In Part II, I mentioned the group I want to reach with my visualization is:
- Young matcha lovers who care about why their favorite drink is suddenly getting more expensive and want to make smarter consumer decisions
- Young consumers who want to understand what’s happening to their favorite drink over the next 5–10 years
In short: If you’re between 12 and 44, have ever posted a photo of yourself happily holding a matcha drink, and are still on the hunt for the best matcha spot in every new city—you’re my target audience.

However, after conducting interviews, I realized I need to narrow this group even further so I can provide deeper, more relevant insights.
Additional characteristics that help me focus include:
- They are price-conscious and economically thoughtful
- They are busy working or studying, so they don’t really have time to research why matcha prices are rising
- They are aware of global trends and supply-chain issues but not in the deep level
- They are open to trying alternatives if prices keep increasing
- They don’t just need information. They need a way out.

My target audience isn’t only curious about why matcha prices are rising. They want to know what they should do next. That means my call to action, especially the practical buying tips, must be clear, concrete, and immediately useful.

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.

## References
> **You should have already included detailed references on your Shorthand story** - if so, you do not need to list them twice, unless you used additional references for specific to your writeup. Use this section to capture any additional special notes or information necessary. If there is additional information for your shorthand readers that you've placed on this page, link from Shorthand to this page. Make sure to double-check that you aren't using copyright material and that you have added / updated any citations or other content that you used to create your data story.  Make sure you have cited external sources correctly.

## AI acknowledgements
For this project, I used AI in several supportive ways. I used it to help me write Markdown code, gather information, transalte from Japanese to English and identify reliable data sources. I also asked it to suggest revisions and recommend visualization types that best communicated my key messages. For my interviews, I used AI to convert the responses into clear, organized tables, which made the analysis much easier.

On the design side, I used Shorthand’s AI features to ensure that the colors and visual tone were consistent throughout the story. And finally, I used AI tools to check and refine my grammar.

# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section.
